  <description summary="Protocol for requesting fractional surface scales">
    This protocol allows a compositor to suggest for surfaces to render at
    fractional scales.

    A client can submit scaled content by utilizing wp_viewport. This is done by
    creating a wp_viewport object for the surface and setting the destination
    rectangle set to the surface size before the scale factor is applied.

    If the surface is not a subsurface, then the buffer size is calculated by
    multiplying the surface size by the intended scale, rounding the result
    halfway away from zero.

    If the surface is a subsurface, then the calculation must account for the
    surface position when rounding the buffer size. First, add the subsurface
    position relative to its parent to the surface size, multiplying them by the
    intended scale and rounding the result halfway away from zero. Second, take
    the subsurface position relative to its parent, multiplying it by the
    intended scale and rounding the result halfway away from zero. Finally,
    subtract the result of the second calculation from the first calculation to
    get the buffer size.

    The wl_surface buffer scale should remain set to 1 in both cases.

    In the compositor, final subsurface positions are calculated by multiplying
    the position of the subsurface relative to its parent by the intended scale,
    and rounding the result halfway away from zero. The positions of the parent
    surfaces, calculated using the same mechanism, are then recursively added to
    the result. This ensures that position and size rounding is not affected by
    the movement of parent surfaces.

    If a surface has a surface-local size of 100 px by 50 px and wishes to
    submit buffers with a scale of 1.5, then a buffer of 150px by 75 px should
    be used and the wp_viewport destination rectangle should be 100 px by 50 px.
